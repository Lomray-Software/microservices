### <a id="how-to-run"></a>HOW TO RUN:
1. Run `Inverted Json` job server.
```bash
docker run -it -p 8001:8001 lega911/ijson --log 47
```
2. Run microservice (please, see `ENVIRONMENTS` above for understand config)
```
npm run start:dev
```
3. Make some request
```bash
curl localhost:8001/ms/payment-stripe -d '{"id": "unique-id", "method": "demo", "params": {}}'
```

If you use `JetBrains` IDE, try to find run configurations in `.run`

You can also install microservice like npm package:
```bash
npm i --save @lomray/microservice-payment-stripe
```

### <a id="how-to-develop"></a>HOW TO DEVELOP:
For develop this microservice, preferred use TDD technique.
You can run all tests with `watch` flag or run one test:
```
// case 1
npm run test -- --watch

// case 2
NODE_ENV=tests TS_NODE_COMPILER_OPTIONS='{"target":"es6"}' mocha --harmony --no-warnings  __tests__/your-test-name.ts --require ts-node/register --recursive --watch

// check code coverage
nyc npm run test
```

That is all. **Don't forget install npm dependencies**
(in root folder & local folder run:  `npm ci`)

1. Fraudulent	- 4000000000000259 - With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed as fraudulent. This type of dispute is protected after 3D Secure authentication.
2. Not received	- 4000000000002685	- With default account settings, charge succeeds, only to be disputed as product not received. This type of dispute isnâ€™t protected after 3D Secure authentication.
